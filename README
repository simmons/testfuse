testfuse - a FUSE filesystem driver for presenting deterministic
           pseudo-random files of various sizes.

This program presents a filesystem containing files of various sizes
composed of deterministic, but pseudorandom data.  The goal is to
provide test files for various network speed testing, without being
bottlenecked by the I/O overhead of hard drives, SSDs, or traditional
filesystem drivers.  Tests show that testfuse can deliver file data
at about 7 Gbps on a circa-2009 Core i7 machine.

The contents of these files are 100% deterministic -- two instances
of testfuse with the same parameters running on different machines
should result in identical filesystems.  This could be useful, for
instance, when staging a BitTorrent swarm.

Usage:
    ./testfuse <file-spec-list> -f <mount-point>

Example:
    $ ./testfuse testfile_1M,1M,1/testfile_1G,1G,0x02 -f /mnt/testfuse
    $ sha1sum /mnt/testfuse/testfile_1M
    1625df500068aa8b85370ba8d488fd4233d59ec1  /mnt/testfuse/testfile_1M
    $ sha1sum /mnt/testfuse/testfile_1M
    1625df500068aa8b85370ba8d488fd4233d59ec1  /mnt/testfuse/testfile_1M
    $ sha1sum /mnt/testfuse/testfile_1G
    d4c8ecd333785fcae74d11747d8e32bf066500b0  /mnt/testfuse/testfile_1G
    $ sha1sum /mnt/testfuse/testfile_1G
    d4c8ecd333785fcae74d11747d8e32bf066500b0  /mnt/testfuse/testfile_1G
    $ dd if=/mnt/testfuse/testfile_1G > /dev/null
    2097152+0 records in
    2097152+0 records out
    1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 1.2609 s, 852 MB/s

The file-spec-list argument is a slash-delimited list of file
specifications, each of which is a comma-delimited tuple indicating
the file name, the file size, and a 32-bit seed value.  Files of the
same size and seed value will always be identical.

Building testfuse
----------------------------------------

You must have the FUSE development library installed to compile this
program.  In Ubuntu, you can install this library with the following
command:

sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev

Then, simply run "make".
